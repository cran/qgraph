Changes in Version 0.4.3
  o Fixed a bug in the 'tooltips' argument in qgraph.
  o Fixed a bug with numeric assignment for the 'arrows' argument on curved lines
  o By default lines are now only curved if there is no other edge with a weight over the minimum between the two nodes instead of if there is any other edge between the two nodes.
  o Greek labels are now identified by using sapply rather than a for-loop.
  o Added 'tex' as filetype. Graphs can now be output in a .tex format using the 'tikzDevice'. The .tex file can then be build in LaTeX compilers. 
  o The 'tooltips' argument can now also be used for filetype='tex'
  o Replaced the use of 'windows' function with the 'dev.new' function. This should fix problems with the default output on platforms other than Windows.
  o By default, a new R window is now only opened if the active device is the NULL-device.
  o Added the 'qgraph.panel' function. Which creates a 4-panel plot with useful default graphs for correlation matrices.
  
Changes in Version 0.4.2
  o Changed the standard output in R to fixed width windows (windows(rescale="fixed"...).
  o Fixed a spelling error in the authors.
  o Minimum and maximum details moved slightly to the center.
  o Fixed a bug in identifying the factors in 'qgraph.loadings'
  o Extended and improved the examples of the qgraph.efa, qgraph.pca and qgraph.loadings functions.
  o Changed qgraph from depending to suggesting the psych, sem and RSVGTipsDevice packages. This enables 64bit users to install the complete package
  o Similar to 'qgraph', 'qgraph.loadings' 'qgraph.efa' and 'qgraph.pca' now also return (invisible) a list of class "qgraph" containing the arguments.
  o Removed scaling of the sizes of arrow heads, and added the argument 'asize' to control arrow head size.
  o Added a new function, 'qgraph.arrow' which will be used to draw the arrowheads instead of 'arrows'. This enables closed arrowheads (by default) as well as better optimalization for pdf output.
